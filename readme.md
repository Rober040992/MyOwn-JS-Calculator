## Features

## Technologies
- **HTML5**: Structure of the calculator.
- **CSS3**: Styling of the interface.
- **JavaScript**: Functional logic for calculations and event handling.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Use the buttons to perform operations.

## Known Issues
- `Function` is used to evaluate operations. Although safer than `eval`, it is not 100% error-proof.
- Error handling is basic and may display "Error" if the expression is invalid.
- After display a result if press a button, the before operation is shown again and makes an error if this is not an operator

## Future Improvements
- Add support for keyboard shortcuts (e.g., press Enter to calculate).
- Implement calculation history.
- Validate operations before evaluating them.
